# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.
#
# ==========================
# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# - The config file consists of simple key-value pairs, separated by equals signs:
#
#	font-family = Iosevka
#	window-padding-x = 2
#
# - Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
#
# - Any line beginning with a # is a comment.
# - It's not possible to put a comment after a config option, it would be interpreted as a
# part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
#	background = #123abc
#
# - Empty values are used to reset config keys to default:
#	key =
#
# - Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value.
# Is explained in the docs for that config option. For example:
#	resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms
#
# ==========================
# Personal notes
# ==========================
# - The configuration can be splitted in different files by using the `config-file` key.
# The value is the path to the required file. This path can be relative, in which cases it
# is considered relative to the file's path that includes it. Example:
#	config-file = plugins/color-scheme/config
#
# - Configuration can be reloaded at runtime by pressing: ctrl+shift+,
# A different keybinging can be defined cia `reload-config` action.
#
# !! Some configuration options cannot be reloaded at runtime and others may apply to new
# instances of the terminal.
